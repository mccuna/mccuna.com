      <p>
        In terms of frameworks and technologies, recently I've discovered Remix
        and fell in love with it. Besides Remix, I've decided to also focus on
        my Javascript-related skills from now on, "archiving" the .Net ones. So
        yeah, this is my journey so far. Who knows what the future will bring?
