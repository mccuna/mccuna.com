      <p>
        Being determined to build frontend apps I've made a job change once
        again and joined Digitall in the summer of 2020 as a frontend developer.
        In terms of "seniority", even though I had 0 professional experience
        using React, my overall experience and the job & client qualified me as
        a "senior developer".
      </p>
      <p>
        I was assigned to a project composed of a Team Lead and 2 other junior
        developers with about 1-2 years of frontend experience. My
        responsibilities in this project were to take technical decisions about
        the architecture together with the team lead, help with the development
        itself, and coach & help the junior developers. So yeah, I had to help
        people with more professional experience than me ðŸ˜… (if you ever felt
        the impostor syndrome, well, this is it on steroids).
      </p>
      <p>
        This impostor syndrome feeling made me learn and grow at an incredible
        speed because I wanted to always be able to help someone when that
        someone reached out to me. On a more general note, this is one more
        example of the benefits of the right amount of stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things turned out great and in a few months, I've taken full
        responsibility for leading the development while the team lead was
        getting dragged into other projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        After about 1 year at Digitall I had an opportunity to join Tokero, one
        of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges from Romania that was based in
        my city. Tokero finished an investment round and was looking to build a
        development team whose immediate goal was to rewrite the existing
        application, an MVP, because it could no longer handle the increasing
        number of customers. Previously, the developer team consisted of only 1
        man, one of the co-founders.
