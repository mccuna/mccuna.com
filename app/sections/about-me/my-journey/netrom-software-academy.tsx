      <h3>NetRom Software Academy</h3>
      <p>
        This changed in my 2nd year of faculty when I found out about Netrom's
        Software Academy. The purpose of the academy was to introduce people
        with zero professional experience to the most popular technologies. For
        an aspiring developer like me, this was a gold mine. I applied and
        passed the admission exam that was meant to select 15-20 people from the
        200+ applicants (I found out years later while working there that I had
        the 2nd highest score from that year).
      </p>
      <p>
        During the academy I got the chance to see what developing apps in .Net,
        Java, php or javascript meant and spend a whole day (shadow day)
        alongside a developer while she was doing her usual work. From the
        technologies presented I've started to really grow into .Net and the
        fact that I got to stay alongside a .Net developer during the shadow day
        cemented my decision to become a .Net developer. At this point, the
        academy participation met its goal, I've got a technology that "clicked"
        for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        About 1 week after the academy ended, I got an email from the company's
        CTO mentioning that I've shown potential and offered an opportunity to
        collaborate with the company to improve my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opportunity consisted basically of me munching as many .Net skills
        as possible in 1 month (the one including the Christmas holidays and New
        Year's Eve ðŸŽ„), taking a test, and then based on it in the company
        creating a plan to improve my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        One month of binge-watching tutorials and building tiny apps later I've
        taken the test. It consisted of 2 days at the company's office where I
        had to build a small app, answer technical questions, and solve various
        challenges. If you're wondering what kind of challenges, let's say that
        one of the best ways to judge how someone debugs code is to make him
        look the other way, break his code and then watch him as he's working on
        fixing it ðŸ˜„.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the test concluded I found out that I accidentally landed a
        software developer job ðŸ˜…. Accidentally because nobody ever mentioned
        the possibility of getting a job and I wasn't expecting my skills to be
        at a junior developer level. As expected I agreed to join the company
        (both, professional experience & a salary were veeery welcomed by the 20
        years old me).
