        <p>
          I'm a {age} years old web developer born and living in Craiova Romania
          (here is a{' '}
          <SecondaryLink isExternalLink href={externalLinks.craiovaGoogleMap}>
            Google Maps link
          </SecondaryLink>{' '}
          if you're wondering where that's on the map).

          I've been passionate about computers and building stuff since when I
          was a little boy and even if at that age I was just playing video
          games, I already felt that growing up, I would end up building things
          on a computer.

          My programming journey started in high school with C++ algorithms.
          Back then I would have rather built fancy apps, but, in hindsight,
          this might have created a foundation for an upcoming software
          developer career.

          The technology spectrum started expanding farther than C++ when I
          joined the faculty and started looking for a technology that would
          "click" for me (I wasn't much of a fan of C++). I've gone from Java to
          php and even to Python but none of them felt like "the one".
