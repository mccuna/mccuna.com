          I'm a {age} years old web developer born and living in Craiova,
          Romania (here is a{' '}

            Google Maps link
          </SecondaryLink>{' '}
          if you're wondering where that's on the map).

          I was passionate about computers and building things from a young age.
          At that time, my main activity was playing video games that consisted
          of building/developing things like a nation in a strategy name or a
          character in an RPG one. Even though I wasn't exactly concerned about
          the future, my gut feeling was that building things on a computer is
          be my calling.

          My programming journey started in high school with C++ algorithms.
          Back then I would have rather built fancy apps but, in hindsight, this
          might have created a foundation for an upcoming software developer
          career.

          The technology spectrum started expanding farther than C++ when I
          joined the faculty and started looking for a technology that would
          "click" for me (I wasn't much of a fan of C++). I've gone from Java to
          php and even to Python but none of them felt like "the one".
