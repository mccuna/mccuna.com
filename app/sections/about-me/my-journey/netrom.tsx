      <p>
        For the first 3 months, I worked on some short-term projects within the
        company as a trial period. After the 3 months have passed I joined the
        project which I was going to work on for nearly 4 years. This project
        was a web application to manage private pension contracts with some
        background routines in a windows service. I've started working on this
        project as a solo developer but over time the team size varied between
        2-3 developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nearly 4 years that I've worked on this project saw me evolve from a
        junior developer that accidentally landed a job to a team leader.
