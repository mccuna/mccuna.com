## Running the app locally

This repo uses `pnpm` as a package manager. If you don't have it installed, check their docs [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm dev`.
   - This starts multiple processes behind the scenes:
     - `pnpm dev:css` - builds the `tailwindcss` classes and watches for changes
     - `pnpm dev:remix` - builds the `remix` app and watches for changes
     - `pnpm dev:miniflare` - starts running the `remix` app using `miniflare`
   - Before starting the above processes it also runs a `pnpm build` to create a production build. This is needed because `miniflare` will throw an error if it finds no app to run

If for some reason you need to debug the server-side part, the `launch.json` file is already configured to run `pnpm dev` in debug mode.

## Notes

- I'm a big fan of splitting things into smaller parts. Because of this, each individual export from a route is present in its own file (e.g. `contact.tsx` and `contact.action.ts`). The `settings.json` file is configured to nest the exports under the route in order to prevent clogging up the `routes` folder. `remix.config.js` is also configured to not create individual routes for these exports
